# RemindR-cordova-android

Project name: RemindR

This is two screen Android Cordova App that lets the user do three things:
- add a local notification;
- list saved local notifications;
- delete an existing local notification.

Layout & Navigation

The first page displays a list of all the pending local notifications.
The second page displays a form that lets a user create a new local notification.
Each of the local notifications listed on the first page will display the title of the notification as well as the time that it is scheduled for. Each local notification item also has a delete icon that the user can click or tap to cancel the notification. Cancelling one of the items should also remove it from the interface list .
I used the Ratchet CSS framework to build my interface. 
My app has a custom icon that it uses for the notifications.

Each local notification has:
1. An id
2. A title
3. A text message
4. A specific time and date
5. An customized iconâ€¨
